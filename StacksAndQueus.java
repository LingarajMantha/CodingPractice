STACKS - > 
FILO or LIFO -> First in last out or last in first out 
EX -> Plates kept in the stack ,, FILO or LIFO

**you cant remove the element or plate from the middle ,, default , it will be removed form the top 
removing -> pop 
adding or inserting in called - > push 
Time Complexity - > 

QUEUES - > 
People standing in the line - > 


Stack Data Structure - > 
 STacks , Queue , graph, maps are the arrays ,, based on their implememtion we dont call them array , but call with individiual name , thats it.

    QUEUE Data Structure - > 
    FIFO or LILO- > 
    Queue is an interface (tell what to do , not how to do . > ), 
where as stack is Class ,

Implemetation of Queue - > 
    Queue <Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
to add elemnts in the Queue
queue.add(3); 
queue.add(5); 
queue.add(7); 
queue.add(32); 

** to remove the elements 
queue.peek (); ->peek functoion  its not remove , but peek or see who is at the head of the queue, just see but will not remove 
queue.remove(); removes head of the queue. lly flow follows.
